## Cumulative COVID-19 vaccination doses administered per 100 people (EBU)

This is counted as a single dose, and may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on the specific dose regime (e.g. people receive multiple doses).

The map shows the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Europe from 1 February 2020 until 26 January 2021 included.

The size of the circle reflects the number of Covid-19 vaccines per population.
